<h1>Introduction about myself</h1>
<p>Hello world! Im akk1to, a developer! I'm a 15-year-old student from Vietnam who's get addicted to coding, building apps, games (also breaking it). I've been hooked on computer since I was 5, start to learn code in 8, starting from Scratch, a cool beginner-friendly programming language that's now very popular with young children! On Scratch, I've tried to make basic games and started to learn about coding language!</p>
<p>Now, at the age of 15, I've already become fluent in some well-known programming language like C++, Java, Python,... But I'm not only coding! I'm also a huge fan of game, especially Minecraft. I've already played Minecraft since I was 8, so that I've played Minecraft for about 7yrs! I love tinkering with it, understanding how it works, and creating my own stuff like plugins and mods. Minecraft is like a dream playground for developers like me.</p>
<p>So, if you wanna explore it with me, let's journey together into the exciting world of coding and gaming. There's so much to explore, and I'm just getting started!</p>
